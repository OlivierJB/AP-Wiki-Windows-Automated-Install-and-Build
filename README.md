# AP-Wiki-Windows-Automated-Install-and-Build

One click install and build of Ardupilot wiki on windows with cygwin
Download file, right click and select "Run with Powershell"

Notes:
- Tested successfully only on win10
- Incompatible with win8.1
- Can be run on top of existing cygwin install
- Will take some time depending on Internet download speed and windows machine, ymmv: 
  - A bit under 3 minutes with 60mbps DL speed and Skylake Corei7 6700
  - 7 minutes with 2014 Ivy Bridge Corei5 laptop.
  - Only builds copter and plane wiki sections, other sections or entire wiki left optional as this takes significant additional time.
